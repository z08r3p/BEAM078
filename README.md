Assignment brief: 
The   MSc   degree   is   awarded   for   demonstration   of   advanced   knowledge   of   the   research methods   within   the   accounting/finance   discipline, advanced   knowledge   of   a   specific   field   of research, advanced   knowledge   of   data-gathering   methods, scholarship   in   use   of   sources   relied on including analytical tools, and a contribution to knowledge development   in accounting/finance. BEAM078 and BEFM022 provides students with the basic   building   blocks   with   which   to   complete   these   fundamental   aspects   of   the   degree   program. 
Your BEAM078/BEFM022 assignment concerns corporate failure (bankruptcy) prediction and you are required to answer the research task below by way of empirical analysis. 
Task: 
The year 2023 saw a large number of   companies filing   for bankruptcy   across the   globe. Your assignment will focus on US corporations   which filed for   Chapter   11 bankruptcy   during   this year. Using the list of   companies provided, you are tasked with developing a model which   can predict the failure of   these companies using data one to five years before bankruptcy   occurs.
Your model(s) must be tested for accuracy and adhere to the minimum requirements detailed within this document. You are to draw upon both the pre-existing academic literature   and   any other factors which you feel may play an important predictive role within the given timeframe.
Requirements: 
Using the tools provided, you are required to conduct independent research to investigate   and   complete the research task. Your final written document should adhere to the   following structure:
•               Abstract
•               Introduction
•               Literature   Review
•             Methodology
•               Data
•             Results
•               Conclusion
•               References
•               Appendices   (where   appropriate)
•
Guidance: 
You will be provided with a list of 10 US corporations which failed   (struck   off   the   stock exchange) during 2023 after filing for Chapter   11 Bankruptcy.   These   companies will be   the   primary   focus   of   your   analyses.
You are required, using the techniques learned within this module, to assess the   ability   of accounting ratios (and other factors if   necessary) to predict bankruptcy. The failed   company group   must   be   compared   a   group   of   healthy   non-bankrupt   companies   within   the   sametime period. A   list   of   non-failed   companies   (also   provided) consists   of   two   healthy   companies   for every one bankrupt firm. These have been matched according to both industry   and   size   (total      assets). You   may   expand   on   the   number   of   non-failed   companies   if   you   wish   by   investigating the “entire database” from WRDS, in 代 写BEAM078 | BEFM022 AssignmentR
代做程序编程语言a similar manner to   how   we   approach   the   example analysis in the class   workshops.
The task must be answered by independently   selecting 5 or more financial ratios (or other   independent variables)– for which the rationale for their selection and inclusion must be clearly defined. Examples and data collection methods will be provided throughout the   course.
The assignment and the research task are deliberately and broadly positioned. Given   the voluminous literature and the many different ways authors have attempted to tackle   this question in the past, students are granted a free   license   to   answer   the   questions   in   any   means   they   feel   appropriate, provided   that   the   sample   of   US   companies   provided   to   them   isused within the analysis.
A minimum requirement to pass this module is that students   should be able   to   determine   if   there any significant differences between failed and non-failed firms   with   regards   to   a   series      of   single accounting ratios (at least 5 of   your choosing).   Using   these   single   (univariate) measures, students should demonstrate the ability to incorporate univariate   measures   into   a   single (or series of) multivariate model(s). Univariate and multivariate   models must be measured for accuracy (the ability to   separate failed   and   non-failed   companies),   and   in   an   appropriate manner (e.g., t-tests. contingency tables, ROC curves).
No validation of model accuracy is required. Given   the   contemporaneous   nature   of   this study there is limited data   available for   a validation   sample.
Students may wish to base their work upon a prior published study (e.g. Altman,   1968), this is acceptable provided that the replication contains a univariate and multivariate element   and         that a detailed discussion is provided as to why the use of   the model   is   appropriate under the given   setting. If   this   approach   is   taken   then   inferences   must   be   drawn   between   the   findings   of the original paper, and those findings produced by the student. Differences   are likely   to   reside   in the accuracy and coefficients of   the model are will   likely be   due to   country   of   study, the era in which the study was conducted, and the types of   company   which   were   analysed.   These   must be detailed and explained in detail within the results. 
Credit will be awarded for originality and plagiarism in any form is not tolerated by the University of Exeter Business School. The assignment is an individual piece of research and must be treated as such. 
Students will be assessed on their ability to:
•         Demonstrate   knowledge   and   understanding   of   the   research   topic;
•         Critically appraise relevant extant research;
•         Provide   a   clear   understanding   of   the   methodology;
•         Interpret   results;
•         Produce   a   clearly   written, well-structured   assignment.
